# Basic-Portfolio

This is a basic portfolio designed exclusively in HTML and CSS for a learning exercise.


## Roadmap

Future iterations of this page will demonstrate a greater understanding of web design tools, and eventually may be used as a professional portfolio for prospective employers.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to my kind instructors for being so helpful and patient as I begin this learning journey.
